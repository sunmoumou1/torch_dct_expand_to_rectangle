# torch_dct_expand_to_rectangle
 This repository is a modified version of the original `torch_dct`. The original code from the repository only supported discrete cosine transform (DCT) and inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) on square matrices. I have extended the functionality to support DCT and IDCT on matrices with unequal height and width, allowing for broader applicability in scenarios where non-square matrices are involved.
